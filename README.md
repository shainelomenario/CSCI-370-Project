School project for CSCI 370. The project showcases the Observer Design Pattern through an email newsletter system. The newsletter acts as the Subject, while the subscriber is the interface where SMS and EmailSubscriber are the concrete observers. The project showcases how subscribers are notified of updates whenever the newsletter publishes new content. JUnit tests were used to check the functionality of the design pattern

To run it on replit, download the JUnit 5 file called "junit-platform-console-standalone.jar" and drag it to the root directory

Then configure the .class and .test files and run commands to run the tests. Honestly, I've had difficult running it so I had to do a lot of research
