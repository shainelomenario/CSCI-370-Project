School project for CSCI 370. The project showcases the Observer Design Pattern through an email newsletter system. The newsletter acts as the Subject, while the subscriber is the interface where SMS and EmailSubscriber are the concrete observers. The project showcases how subscribers are notified of updates whenever the newsletter publishes new content. JUnit tests were used to check the functionality of the design pattern.
